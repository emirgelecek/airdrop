zkSync is a ZK rollup, a trustless protocol that uses cryptographic validity proofs to provide scalable and low-cost transactions on Ethereum. In zkSync, computation is performed off-chain and most data is stored off-chain as well. As all transactions are proven on the Ethereum mainchain, users enjoy the same security level as in Ethereum.

zkSync has raised a total of $458 million from leading investors like Blockchain Capital and Dragonfly Capital. Theyâ€™ve hinted that they will launch their native token in the future, so trying out their mainnet and testnet may make you eligible for an airdrop when they launch their token. We highly recommend you to do transactions on a regular basis to increase your chances to become eligible, like every month or week for example.
